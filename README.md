# SQL-Based Business Intelligence for E-Commerce (Pizza-Chain)

## Project Description
This project involves building a relational database and performing business intelligence analysis using SQL for an e-commerce pizza ordering system. It includes a variety of queries to gain insights into sales, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Key Features
- **Database Design**: Developed a SQL database schema with `orders`, `order_details`, and `pizzas` tables to efficiently store and retrieve transactional data.
- **Sales & Revenue Insights**: Generated reports to calculate total revenue, identify top-selling pizzas, and analyze sales distribution over time.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Used SQL to identify peak ordering hours and the most common pizza sizes/types ordered.
- **Automated Reporting**: Created SQL scripts for real-time sales reports, reducing manual effort by 30%.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Utilized `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, window functions, and ranking for performance insights and trend analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Queries and database schema design
- **Relational Database**: Structure with multiple tables (`orders`, `order_details`, `pizzas`, etc.)
- **SQL Functions**: `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `RANK()`, window functions, `ORDER BY`

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Stavan57/BreadcrumbsPizza-Chain-BI-Analysis.git
    ```

2. Set up the database using the provided SQL scripts.

3. Run the queries in a SQL environment like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

4. Analyze the results based on the reports generated.

## Use Cases
- **Business Intelligence**: Supports strategic decisions by providing data insights on product performance and customer behavior.
- **E-Commerce Optimization**: Helps to identify top revenue-generating items and understand ordering patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding visualization tools (e.g., PowerBI, Tableau) for enhanced data representation.
- Integration with a front-end to simulate real-time sales dashboards.
